"""Pattern of life: what normal looks like at one site, learned from that site.

PRD section 16 calls this the long-term differentiator and that is right, but
for an unobvious reason. The moat is not the algorithm -- it is a dozen lines
of robust statistics. The moat is that a baseline takes months of a specific
AOI's history to build, so the second vendor to monitor a customer's port
starts a year behind the first, however good their models are.

Three decisions do most of the work.

**Median and MAD, not mean and standard deviation.** One cloudy scene or one
genuinely unusual day would otherwise poison the definition of normal for
weeks, and a baseline that moves toward the anomaly is a baseline that stops
detecting it. That is the classic failure of naive pattern-of-life: monitor a
site through a slow build-up and the system silently accepts it as the new
normal.

**A weekday term.** A container port handles three times as many trucks on
Tuesday as on Sunday. A baseline without a weekday term reports an anomaly
every weekend, forever, and the analyst turns the alerts off.

**Baselines are tied to an AOI's geometry fingerprint.** Redraw the boundary
and the history does not carry over, because it was measured over a different
patch of ground. Silently carrying it is how a platform ends up defending a
number it cannot explain.
