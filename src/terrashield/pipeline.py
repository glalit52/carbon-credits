"""The monitoring run: catalogue to alert, once per AOI per day.

This is the loop PRD section 33 describes, and its job is less to be clever
than to be *repeatable*. A monitoring platform is judged on whether it says the
same thing twice about the same day, so every stage is idempotent: re-running a
date range rewrites the same rows rather than duplicating them, because ids are
derived from content rather than from a counter.

The sequence:

    search        what imagery exists, usable and not
    fetch         pixels, plus the provider's cloud and water bands
    detect        objects, with the classes the sensor cannot support declared
    observe       today's metrics, weighted by how much of the AOI was visible
    compare       change against the best legitimate earlier scene
    baseline      normal, from this AOI's own history before today
    assess        deviation from that normal, with its working
    risk          severity, confidence, novelty, persistence, spatial reach
    evidence      what each finding rests on, hashed
    alert         rules, deduplication, suppression, ranking

Two things are deliberately not here. There is no stage that decides what a
change *means* -- that is the analyst's, and the schema has nowhere to put it.
And there is no stage that silently skips a day: a day with no usable imagery
produces a recorded gap, because an empty timeline and an unobserved one look
identical on a chart and are completely different in a briefing.
