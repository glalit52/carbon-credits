"""Object detection: what is in one scene, and what the sensor could not have seen.

The second half of that sentence is the part most detection engines skip, and
it is the part that decides whether an intelligence product is trustworthy.

A 4.5 m car occupies 20% of one Sentinel-2 pixel. No model, however good,
recovers it -- the information is not in the data. A system that returns
"0 vehicles detected" from a 10 m scene has told the analyst something false by
implication: that it looked and found none. So `detect` returns a
`DetectionResult` carrying both the detections and the classes it refused to
look for, with the reason, and the dashboard shows the refusal next to the
counts. That refusal is also a sales conversation -- vehicle-level
pattern-of-life requires tasked sub-metre imagery, which has a price -- and it
is better had at the demo than in month three of a pilot.

The detector itself is a classical pipeline: background suppression, robust
thresholding, connected components, then classification against a table of real
object dimensions. A fine-tuned YOLO or a geospatial foundation model would beat
it on a real scene and should replace it behind the same interface. What should
not change is the shape of the output: every detection carries the scene it came
from, its measured extent, and a confidence that means something, because
`calibration_report` measures whether it does.
