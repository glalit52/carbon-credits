"""Risk scoring: the five dimensions an analyst actually triages on.

PRD section 18 lists severity, confidence, novelty, persistence and spatial
significance, and keeping them as five numbers rather than collapsing them into
one is the whole point. They answer different questions and they disagree
usefully:

  severity      how much would this matter if it is real
  confidence    how sure are we that it is real
  novelty       has this site ever looked like this before
  persistence   is it still there, or was it a one-look artefact
  spatial       how much of the AOI it affects

A single blended number cannot distinguish a confident observation of something
minor from a shaky observation of something major, and those need opposite
responses. The composite exists only to order a queue; the five components are
what is shown beside it, and what the analyst argues with.

Persistence deserves particular note because it resolves the ambiguity the
change engine cannot. At 10 m, a cluster of shipping containers arriving in a
port yard and a new building going up produce nearly identical evidence in a
single pair. What separates them is that the containers are gone next week.
