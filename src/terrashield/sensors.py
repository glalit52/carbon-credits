"""The imaging model: how a place on the ground becomes a grid of numbers.

The point of modelling the sensor rather than drawing a picture is that the
limits come out right. Three of them drive real product decisions:

**Resolution is linear mixing, not blur.** A 4.5 m car inside a 10 m Sentinel-2
pixel contributes 8.5% of that pixel's value, so it is invisible under any
detector. This module reproduces that by weighting each object's contribution
by its true fractional coverage of the cell. The consequence -- that
vehicle-count pattern-of-life needs tasked sub-metre imagery and cannot be sold
on free Sentinel data -- is a commercial fact, and a demo that hid it would be
selling something that does not exist.

**Sun angle is a change signal if you let it be.** The same site imaged in
December and June differs in brightness by more than most construction does.
That is why change.py normalises radiometrically before differencing, and why
this module bothers to vary illumination at all.

**SAR speckle is multiplicative.** It does not average out the way additive
noise does, and a detector tuned on optical imagery falls apart on it. Modelled
here so the engines have to cope.
