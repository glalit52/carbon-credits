"""Anomaly scoring: how far today is from this site's own history.

The scoring is the easy part. The discipline is in what the output is allowed
to say, and PRD section 55 is unambiguous: never "threat detected", always
"significant deviation from baseline", followed by what changed, where, when,
the evidence, the confidence, and why the model considers it unusual.

That is not squeamishness. A system that outputs intent is asserting something
it has no access to -- satellite imagery contains no intentions -- and the first
time it is confidently wrong in front of a customer, everything else it says
becomes suspect too. A system that outputs deviation is asserting something it
genuinely measured, and the analyst supplies the meaning. `AnomalyFinding`
therefore has a score, contributions and reasons, and no field anywhere in
which a motive could be recorded.

Confidence is separate from score on purpose. A large deviation measured
against eight observations through broken cloud is a big number that should not
be trusted, and collapsing the two into one figure is how that distinction gets
lost on the way to the dashboard.

#: willing to call a building, in different illumination, through a different
#: gap in the cloud. At 10 m that variation is larger than any real weekly
#: change in the built environment, so scoring it produces a stream of
#: confident, high-severity alerts about nothing -- which is precisely what the
#: first full run of the demo estate produced: every single priority-1 alert
#: across four sites was "activity deviation driven by building count".
