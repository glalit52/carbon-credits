"""Check the committed TerraShield console against its own dataset.

Not the same check `check_dashboard_fresh.py` does for the MRV dashboard. That
one regenerates the dataset and compares, which it can afford because the feed
is a fast deterministic simulation. Regenerating this one means running six
months of the monitoring pipeline over four sites -- hours of work -- so a CI
job cannot do it, and pretending otherwise would give a check that is either
skipped or always red.

What this does check is the drift that actually happens: someone rebuilds
data.json and forgets to rebuild index.html, or prunes chips, or adds a site
whose imagery never got rendered. All of that is cheap to catch and all of it
produces a page that is wrong in a way a reader cannot see.
